**Poisson Calculator**

**Description:**
This program calculates the probability of Poisson given an lambda (λ) and value of k. 
utilizes the Poisson probability formula: 

```
px(k) = (λ^k * e^(-λ)) / k!
```
## Installations:
1. **Download the code**: Download the program code from the project.
2. **Building the program**: In the terminal, run the command 'make all' to compile the program.
3. **Running**: To run the main you need to give Two arguments: 
        - The first argument is λ (lambda), representing the average rate of occurrence.
        - The second argument is k, representing the number of occurrences.
        For example: `./main 2.5 3` calculates the probability for λ=2.5 and k=3.
4. **Output**: The program will output the calculated probability `px(k)`.

**Files:**
- `main.c`: Contains the main function to interact with the user and execute the calculations.
- `poisson.c`: Implements functions to calculate the Poisson distribution probability.
- `poisson.h`: Header file containing function declarations and necessary includes.
- `makefile`: Automates the compilation process.

**Example Usage:**
```
$ ./main 2.5 3
px(3) = 0.2139
```

This indicates that for λ=2.5 and k=3, the probability `px(3)` is approximately 0.2139.
